# Random Number Generator :abacus:

## Project Overview
The Random Number Generator is a basic website which takes two inputs from a user and generates a random number. The application is based off of a Treehouse Tutorial which can be accessed [here](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/random-number-challenge). This is also a part of my 1<sup>st</sup> round of the **100 Days of Code Challenge**.

## Inital Work
The inital work was completed by following along the with the Treehouse tutorial, with some small edits along the way.
